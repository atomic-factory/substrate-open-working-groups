## Summary

We are currently working on a protocol for NFT migration and data exchange. The protocol aims to standardize the procedure and the information sufficient and/or necessary for the migration of an ERC-721 compatible asset from one universe to another, as well as the data structure for cross-universe NFT tracking. This protocol is at the first draft stage and we are asking for feedback from the community. The aim of the standard is to be as generic and inclusive as possible. This project is supported by the Web3 Foundation.

## Motivation

Assets of all kinds will soon be tokenized and traded as non-fungible tokens, fostering the need for a standard to migrate and track the ownership of these assets across universes.

## Setup

The protocol is being redacted on a Google Document that we invite the community to read and add their comments to: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c5Uor2By5igFWXimipcKhsWjTAG8OWrl9bSVWTPsi6U/edit?usp=sharing

We also encourage contributors to share their feedback, ask questions and take part in the discussions here or in our NFT Migration Protocol Telegram channel:
